<h1>Good Websites</h1>
<a href="http://appstore.ca/">App Store Canada</a>
<p>The different news are easily identifiable because of the same amount of space allocated to each news article and you can tell their news because of the clear blue heading. The blue from the headings and the navigation contrast the subsections well.

<p>The logo has yellow so its easy to distinguish. The links are clearly links because they're blue and underlined. Everything is nicely listed with bullets and alligned to each other.</p>
<h1>Bad Websites</h1>

<p>The rainbow background makes it hard to read the text. I could not tell the images in the bottom were links.</p>

<p>The yellow text makes it hard to read with the red background. Headings are not big enough. Everythings alligned down the center so it makes the website very long. The background repitition is not easy on the eyes.</p>
